# email_scraper

Single threaded data scraper that will loop through a txt file of predefined domains, crawl the domains and then scrape and save any found emails to txt.

I'm from the internet.


====== Txt files associated with script ======

scraped_emails.txt is an uncleaned original list of perceieved email data.
final_scraped_emails.txt is the clensed list from scraped_emails.txt

I will update the script to be more incongnito with use of header data and proxies, just had no need at this point.
